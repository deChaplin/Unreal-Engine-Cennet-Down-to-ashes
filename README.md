This was our first project in year 1 of university. We'd only have a couple of hours of hands on experience with Unreal Engine 4 before begining on this project.

For this project there wasn't set roles. Below is a list of my contributions:

- Creation and addition of sprites
- Fixing issues (there was a lot)
- Implementing core game mechanics
- Adding basic movement to enemies
- Designing and creating levels
- Camera fading when the player dies
- Background music
- Out of bounds area of map
